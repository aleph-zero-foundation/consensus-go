// Package gomel defines all the interfaces representing basic components for executing the Aleph protocol.
//
// The main components defined in this package are:
//  1. The unit and preunit representing the information produced by a single process in a single round of the protocol.
//  2. The dag, containing all the units created by processes and representing the partial order between them.
//  3. The random source interacting with the dag to generate randomness needed for the protocol.
//  4. The linear ordering that uses the dag and random source to eventually output a linear ordering of all units.
package gomel
